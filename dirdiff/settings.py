"""Every input the run depends on, declared in one place.

Public interface:
    load(config, base_dir) -> Settings
    Settings   namedtuple(prompts, risk, normalizers, tuning, digest)

The prompts, the risk labels the extraction looks for, and the normalizer command
lines are inputs, not code. On a closed network a reviewer has to be able to read
and approve the exact text that leaves the box without reading Python, so all of
it is declarable in the config file and defaults to the values below when absent.

Two rules make this safe rather than merely flexible:

  * A prompt may be written inline or as "@relative/path.md", resolved against the
    config file's directory, so prose stays reviewable Markdown instead of JSON
    escapes.
  * Placeholders are validated at load. An unknown or missing one is a startup
    error, because the alternative is discovering a mangled prompt three files
    into a review.

The risk labels live here beside the prompts on purpose. `_extract_risk` looks for
the literal label the prompt asks the model to write; translating one without the
other makes every badge silently disappear. They are one coupled input.

**Connections** — findings in one file that bear on another. Say which files.
