# MaNishtana — air-gap delivery image.
#
# Bundles the one dependency the tool cannot degrade without (git) and the two
# optional normalizers (clang-format, gcc), so the closed network needs no
# package repository. See README.md for the build / transfer / run sequence.
#
# For a reproducible transfer artifact, pin the base image by digest:
#   docker inspect --format '{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' python:3.11-slim
# and replace the FROM line with the python@sha256:... value it prints.

FROM python:3.11-slim

# No USER is set, deliberately. Nothing here needs a particular uid — git's
# config is system-wide and nothing under /opt is written at runtime — so the
# caller passes --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" and the reports land owned by them
# rather than by root. Hardcoding a uid would break exactly that, and would
# also make every bind-mounted output directory unwritable.
